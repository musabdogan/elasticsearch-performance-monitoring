  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the Elasticsearch Performance Monitoring Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "the Extension") handles information when you use our extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information necessary for the extension to function:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cluster configurations:</strong> When you add an Elasticsearch cluster, you may provide cluster URLs and optional authentication credentials (username/password). This information is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API.</li>
    <li><strong>User preferences:</strong> Your theme preference (dark/light mode), polling interval (e.g. 10s, 30s), alert settings, and selected active cluster are stored locally on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    The information you provide is used solely for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To connect to your Elasticsearch clusters and retrieve performance and health data</li>
    <li>To maintain your preferences and settings across sessions</li>
    <li>To provide the core functionality of the extension (monitoring dashboard, alerts)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All data collected by the Extension is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. We do not:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transmit any data to external servers</li>
    <li>Share your data with third parties</li>
    <li>Use your data for advertising or analytics</li>
    <li>Access your data remotely</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your cluster configurations and credentials remain on your device and are never sent to us or any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retrieved from Elasticsearch Clusters</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension connects only to Elasticsearch clusters that you configure. It retrieves technical monitoring data such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cluster health status</li>
    <li>Indexing and search rates and latencies</li>
    <li>Index statistics (shards, size, document counts)</li>
    <li>Node statistics and resource usage (CPU, JVM heap, storage)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is displayed in the extension's dashboard and is not stored permanently or transmitted elsewhere. It is used only for real-time monitoring and is not sent to our servers or any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Extension requires the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save your cluster configurations and preferences locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Host permissions (&lt;all_urls&gt;):</strong> To connect to Elasticsearch clusters that you specify. The extension only connects to clusters you manually add and does not automatically visit or monitor any other websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does not use any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data collection services. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. Your data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You have full control over your data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can add or remove cluster configurations at any time</li>
    <li>You can clear all stored data by uninstalling the extension</li>
    <li>All data is stored locally and can be managed through Chrome's extension settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
